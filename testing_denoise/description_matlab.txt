NLmeans
- NLmeansfilter(input,t,f,h)
- t : radio of search window
- f : radio of similarity window
- h : degree of filtering


Gaussian(should be implemented by matlab2018)
- imgaussfilt(A,sigma,'FilterSize',SizeValue,'FilterDomain',DomainValue)
- sigma : Standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution. 0.5 (default)
- 'FilterSize' : Size of the Gaussian filter. 2*ceil(2*SIGMA)+1 (default)
- 'FilterDomain' : Domain in which to perform filtering. 'auto' (default) | 'spatial' | 'frequency'


bilateral filtering(should be implemented by matlab2018)
- imbilatfilt(I,degreeOfSmoothing,spatialSigma,'NeighborhoodSize',SizeValue)
- degreeOfSmoothing : The default value of degreeOfSmoothing depends on the data type of image I, and is calculated as 0.01*diff(getrangefromclass(I)).^2
- spatialSigma : Standard deviation of spatial Gaussian smoothing kernel, specified as a positive number.
- 'NeighborhoodSize',sizeValue : Neighborhood size, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'NeighborhoodSize' and an odd-valued positive integer. By default, the neighborhood size is 2*ceil(2*SpatialSigma)+1 pixels


Anisotropic(should be implemented by matlab2018)
- imdiffusefilt(I,Name,Value)
- 'GradientThreshold' : numeric scalar. The value of GradientThreshold controls the conduction process by classifying gradient values as an actual edge or as noise. Increasing the value of GradientThreshold smooths the image more. The default value is 10% of the dynamic range of the image.
- 'NumberOfIterations' : 5 (default)
- 'Connectivity' : 'maximal' (default)| 'minimal'. Connectivity of a pixel to its neighbors, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'Connectivity' and one of these values:
'maximal' — Considers 8 nearest neighbors for 2-D images, and 26 nearest neighbors for 3-D images
'minimal' — Considers 4 nearest neighbors for 2-D images, and 6 nearest neighbors for 3-D images
- 'ConductionMethod' : 'exponential' (default) | 'quadratic'. Conduction method, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'ConductionMethod' and 'exponential' or 'quadratic'. Exponential diffusion favors high-contrast edges over low-contrast edges. Quadratic diffusion favors wide regions over smaller regions.
